When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)
nhgis0011_ts_state <- read.csv("~/Documents/Hist698/week6/historydata/data-raw/nhgis0011_ts_state.csv", header=TRUE, na.strings="NA", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

statepop<-nhgis0011_ts_state
statepop<-statepop %>% 
  tbl_df() %>%
  select(YEAR,
         state = STATE,
         pop = A00AA) %>%
  group_by(YEAR)%>%
  summarise(Population=sum(pop, na.rm=TRUE))

kable(statepop)


```
