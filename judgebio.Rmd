This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)

jb <- read.csv("~/Documents/Hist698/week6/jb.txt", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

judgest<-jb 
judgest<-judgest %>% 
  tbl_df() %>%

  select(year=Birth.year,
         state = Place.of.Birth..State.,
         id = Judge.Identification.Number) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(count=n())
kable(judgest)
  
##       mutate(Birth.year = as.numeric(judgest$Birth.year))%>%
##  mutate(Birth.year, year = ntile(Birth.year, 10))%>%              
                                        
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
