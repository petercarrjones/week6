This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)

csv_files <- Sys.glob("~/Documents/Hist698/week6/historydata/data-raw/nhgis0002_csv/*state.csv")

farmvalue<-lapply(csv_files, read.csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings="NA")

farmvalue_reshaped <- lapply(farmvalue, function(df) {
  df %>%
    gather(code, value, -GISJOIN, -YEAR, -STATE, -STATEA, -COUNTY, -COUNTYA, -AREANAME) %>%
    tbl_df()
  })

farmvalue <- rbind_all(farmvalue_reshaped)


head(farmvalue)



```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
