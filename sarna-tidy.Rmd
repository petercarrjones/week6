This is an attempt to turn the Sarna raw dataset (from lmullen's historydata)
from a wide dataset into a tall and tidy dataset.

```{r}
#Load Libraries and data
#library(historydata)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

sarna <- read.csv("~/Documents/Hist698/week6/historydata/data-raw/sarna.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Now start to tidy the data

sarna <- sarna %>% 
  tbl_df() %>%
  select(year,
         pop_low = estimate_low,
         pop_high = estimate_high,
         perc_low = percentage_pop_low,
         perc_high = percentage_pop_high) %>%
  
  gather(estimate, value, -year) 
View(sarna)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(filter(sarna, estimate == "perc_low"), aes(year, value)) + geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
