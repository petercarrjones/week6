This is an attempt to turn the Sarna raw dataset (from lmullen's historydata)
from a wide dataset into a tall and tidy dataset.

```{r}
#Load Libraries and data
library(historydata)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

sarna <- read.csv("~/week6/historydata/data-raw/sarna.csv")



```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
